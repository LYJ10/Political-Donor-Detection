Donor / Customer Detector
- To help political fundraisers accurately identify donors and optimize the donation acquisition process, developed a Donor Detector using a dataset of 6.6 million donors.
- Organized and cleaned data, transformed data using label, frequency, and one-hot encoding, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), generated new features with domain knowledge, and built binary classification
models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and ANN.
- Found Random Forest outperformed other models with the highest precision (.90) and ROC-AUC (.93).
- Provided business insight to optimize fundraising strategies.
- Boosted precision from 56% to 90%, a 60% increase, potentially adding $126 million in annual donations.
- Wrapped the best model as an API using Flask and deployed it on GCP.
